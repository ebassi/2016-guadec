in the X world. X developers, though a misunderstanding of how modern GPUs
worked, created the RENDER extension to the core protocol, which added
Porter-Duff compositing operators to pixel buffers, and a library called
"Cairo" exploiting them was created. Instead of making the X server know
how to render all the possible font types on this planet, or have
applications send the whole font vector data over the wire thus requiring
Gb/s connections to render "Hello world" in Comic Sans, toolkits started
using client side buffers to shape text. Once the forbidden fruit of doing
things in a sensible way had been tasted, the end of the Network Transparent
Age came quickly.</p></div></div><div class="step step-level-1" step="25" data-x="18200" data-y="0" data-rotate-x="0" data-rotate-y="0" data-rotate-z="90" data-scale="1" data-z="0"><h1 id="cairo">Cairo</h1><div class="notes"><p>GTK+ 2.8 introduced the dependency on Cairo, and developers were asked to

interesting results, so the old drawing API was deprecated, and waiting
to be placed on the chopping block in the next major API bump.</p></div></div><div class="step step-level-1" step="26" data-rotate-x="0" data-rotate-y="0" data-rotate-z="90" data-scale="1" data-x="19200" data-y="0" data-z="0"><h1 id="client-side-windows">Client-side windows</h1><div class="notes"><p>In GTK+ 2.18 changed the way GTK would draw once again, by dropping
